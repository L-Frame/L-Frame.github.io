        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I am currently a junior at University of Massachusetts-Amherst as an English major with a concentration in creative writing and specialization in Professional Writing and Technical Communication.</p>
        
        <h3>My Story</h3>
        <p> I have a lifelong love of writing that I hope to combine with my love and knowledge of cats, cooking, and environmental subjects such as native planting and pollinators, for both fiction and nonfiction or educational pieces.<br />I am interested in creating and participating in multimedia projects that help spread knowledge of environmental issues and stewarding into local and underserved communities.<br />When I am not working or studying, I can be found spending time with my three cats while designing cat beds and toys, gardening, cooking, and visiting local orchards and farms.</p>
